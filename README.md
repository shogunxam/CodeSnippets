## Nested Vectors Recursion
The [NestedVectorsRecursion](https://github.com/shogunxam/CodeSnippets/blob/90857a8ddbaa7d11d7c301312c14f75ca3a7ecbb/NestedVectorsRecursion.cpp) module contains an implementation of two template functions to recursivelly modify or print the content of nested std::vectors.
The two methods are impelemented using the SFINAE ( Substitution Failure Is Not An Error ) principle.
